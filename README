## AirLine Ticket Search

We were given source code that we then modified to allow users to input key words like the destination, the time, the airlines they are with, their seat number, etc.
Microsoft SQL Server was used to store information about the flights.
Eventually added Hibernate to embed the database into the program. 
For this example we only used the destination and airline they are with for testing purposes in the database.
Spring was also introduced but not used as the current form was more managable for the short time we worked on this project.
